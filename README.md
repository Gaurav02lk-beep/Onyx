# Onyx : AI Assistance
recently built ONYX, an AI-powered search engine + chatbot designed to make information access more intuitive, interactive, and engaging.

✨ Key Highlights of ONYX
🔹 Multi-Input Support – Users can interact with ONYX through text, images, or even by uploading queries in different formats.
🔹 AI-Powered Responses – Delivers fast, frequent, and highly relevant answers to user queries.
🔹 Narrator Mode 🎙️ – A unique feature where ONYX reads out responses line by line, making it more inclusive and helpful for all users.
🔹 Visual Context 🖼️ – Along with every text response, ONYX generates a contextual image to visually represent the answer.
🔹 Modern Tech Stack – Built using React.js, ensuring a smooth, responsive, and scalable user experience.

With ONYX, my goal was to create a more immersive and accessible search experience where users can not only read but also listen and visualize answers to their queries.

💻 This project allowed me to explore:
✅ React-based UI development
✅ AI integration for conversational search
✅ Real-time text-to-speech (TTS)
✅ Dynamic image generation for enhanced UX

I'm really excited about how ONYX bridges the gap between traditional search engines and interactive AI assistants!
